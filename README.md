# YOLO-darknet
A yolo darknet implementation for image recognition and Object detection
The first folder is to train the detection file.
the second folder is to import the darknet model as it works optimally with Yolo V3 and higher versions.
Transfer learning could help training these models however, I have used a rudimental implementation of the model.
