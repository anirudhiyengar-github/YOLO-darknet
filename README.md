# YOLO-darknet
A yolo darknet implementation for image recognition and Object detection
The first folder is to train the detection file.
the second folder is to import the darknet model as it works optimally with Yolo V3 and higher versions.
Transfer learning could help training these models however, I have used a rudimental implementation of the model.

1)Unzip the folder attached
2) Run the training file on your dataset with your weights or just use the weighted model in the folder. 
3) Run the test folder to see the results of the model training
